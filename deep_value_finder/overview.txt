ticker filtering - this file is used to get stocks from the nasdaq
and filter our super volatile and low volume stocks to insure that no
meme stocks or other stocks that could affect the models data and
prediction for more common stocks

Notes:
- mainly the thing you can change is the requirements for the tickers

company_data_value - this file is used complete the training data by 
by getting looping through the tickers getting every yearly report 
and then getting the close price in 9 months

Notes:
-could potentially loop and find the . quarterly to get grater 
and more similar data
-might want to make a EV / Ebidta also maybe a rolling average price 
just to give it a baseline

look.ipynb - this file is simply a tool used to look at the data frames
created so that the user can verify that the tables look correct

Notes:
-nothing just a tester file

Learning_based on reports - gets the data and runs it through a
gradient boosted regressor with around 2-3 potential metrics to try and
play with to see what gets the best results

Notes:
- could play with different models outside of gradient boosting
- could try finding the expected increase then adding it to remove
the issue of trying to find the price by itself
-experiment with grater data even if the data is less valuable because
it is from worse stocks
